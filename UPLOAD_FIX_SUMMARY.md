# Upload 500 Error - Final Fix Summary

## Root Cause
The `documents` table in Supabase has a field called `file_path`, but the backend code was trying to insert into a field called `url` which doesn't exist.

## Schema Issue
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.documents (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  name text NOT NULL,
  file_path text NOT NULL,  -- Backend was using 'url' instead
  file_type text,
  file_size bigint,
  entity_type text NOT NULL,
  entity_id uuid NOT NULL,
  uploaded_by uuid,
  document_category text,
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

## Fix Applied
Changed line 73 in `python_api/app/routes/uploads.py`:
- **Before**: `"url": public_url,`
- **After**: `"file_path": public_url,`

## Deployment Status
✅ **Fixed**: Code updated
✅ **Pushed**: To GitHub (commit e9d07f5)
⏳ **Deploying**: Render should auto-deploy in 2-5 minutes

## What to Do
1. **Wait** for Render to finish deploying (check https://dashboard.render.com)
2. **Test** image upload again
3. If it still fails, check Render logs for detailed error messages

## Additional Fixes Made
1. Made `entity_id` optional (can be empty string)
2. Improved error logging for debugging
3. Removed bucket auto-creation (requires manual setup)
4. Fixed entity_id type handling (now accepts UUID strings)

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Upload should succeed
- File stored in Supabase Storage
- Record created in `documents` table with correct schema
- Public URL returned to frontend

**Status**: Fixed and deploying
**Last Update**: October 28, 2025
**Next Step**: Wait for Render deployment and test
