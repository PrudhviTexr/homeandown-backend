# Owner and Agent Name Display Fix ✅

## Problem
The properties table in the admin dashboard was showing empty cells for OWNER and AGENT columns.

## Root Cause
The backend API was returning properties with owner_id and agent_id, but not populating the owner_name and agent_name fields that the frontend was expecting.

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes (`admin.py` and `admin_updated.py`)

The fix ensures that:

1. **User Map Creation**: Builds a map of user IDs to full names (first + last name)
   ```python
   user_map = {user['id']: f"{user.get('first_name', '')} {user.get('last_name', '')}".strip() 
                for user in users}
   ```

2. **Owner Name Resolution**:
   - First checks `owner_id` field
   - Falls back to `added_by` field (who created/uploaded the property)
   - Maps the ID to the actual user name
   - Shows "N/A" if no owner found

3. **Agent Name Resolution**:
   - First checks `assigned_agent_id` field (actively assigned agent)
   - Falls back to `agent_id` field (original agent)
   - Maps the ID to the actual user name
   - Shows "Unassigned" if no agent found

### Logic Flow

```python
# Get owner name - check owner_id first, then added_by
owner_id = prop.get('owner_id') or prop.get('added_by')
owner_name = user_map.get(owner_id, 'N/A')
# Ensure we never return empty strings
prop['owner_name'] = owner_name if owner_name and owner_name.strip() else 'N/A'

# Get agent name - check assigned_agent_id first, then agent_id
agent_id = prop.get('assigned_agent_id') or prop.get('agent_id')
agent_name = user_map.get(agent_id, 'Unassigned')
# Ensure we never return empty strings
prop['agent_name'] = agent_name if agent_name and agent_name.strip() else 'Unassigned'
```

## Business Logic

### Owner Assignment
- **Primary**: Uses `owner_id` if present
- **Fallback**: Uses `added_by` (the person who uploaded the property)
- **Result**: Shows the name of who owns/uploaded the property

### Agent Assignment
- **Primary**: Uses `assigned_agent_id` (manually assigned by admin)
- **Fallback**: Uses `agent_id` (the agent who created the property)
- **Result**: Shows "Unassigned" if no agent is associated

### Rules
1. Agent who adds a property → That agent becomes the agent
2. Non-agent who adds a property → Whoever accepts/assigned becomes the agent
3. Owner is always the person who uploaded/owns the property

## What Changed

### Before:
- Properties had IDs but no names
- Frontend displayed empty cells
- User experience was poor

### After:
- Properties include `owner_name` and `agent_name` fields
- These are full names (first + last name), not IDs
- Empty strings are handled gracefully
- Shows "N/A" or "Unassigned" when appropriate

## Files Modified

1. `python_api/app/routes/admin.py` - Main admin endpoint
2. `python_api/app/routes/admin_updated.py` - Updated admin endpoint
3. Both files now have:
   - Better error handling
   - Validation to prevent empty strings
   - Debug logging
   - Proper fallback logic

## Testing

After deploying to Render, verify:

1. **Admin Dashboard Properties Tab**:
   - Open Properties section
   - Check OWNER column - should show names like "John Doe"
   - Check AGENT column - should show names or "Unassigned"

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Properties without owner → Shows "N/A"
   - Properties without agent → Shows "Unassigned"
   - Properties with both → Shows full names

## API Response Example

### Before:
```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "title": "Property Title",
  "owner_id": "uuid-123",
  "agent_id": "uuid-456"
}
```

### After:
```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "title": "Property Title",
  "owner_id": "uuid-123",
  "agent_id": "uuid-456",
  "owner_name": "John Doe",
  "agent_name": "Jane Smith"
}
```
