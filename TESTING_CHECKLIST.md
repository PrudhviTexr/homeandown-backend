## Common Issues & Solutions

### "License Number Not Showing"
**Fix:** Already fixed! Refresh the page.
- Backend now returns `agent_license_number` in `/api/auth/me`
- Frontend will automatically display it

### "Can't Edit Certain Fields"
**This is intentional!** These fields are read-only for security:
- License Number → System-generated, contact admin
- Bank Details → Use "Update Bank Details" with OTP
- Email Verified → Automatic when email confirmed
- Status → Admin-only
- User Type → Admin-only

### "Email Not Received"
**Check:**
1. Spam/Junk folder
2. Resend API email service configured
3. Backend logs: Look for "Profile update confirmation email sent"
4. Email address is correct in profile

### "Updates Not Saving"
**Check:**
1. No error messages on screen
2. Browser console (F12) for errors
3. Backend logs for "Profile updated successfully"
4. JWT token is valid (not expired)
