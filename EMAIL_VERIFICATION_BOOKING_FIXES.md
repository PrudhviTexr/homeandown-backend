# Email Verification, Booking, and My Bookings Fixes

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Email Verification Banner Showing After Verification ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Email verification banner was showing even after user verified their email via OTP.

**Root Cause**: 
- In database, `email_verified` was stored as string `'false'` instead of boolean `false`
- Email banner was only checking for `=== true` (strict equality)
- After OTP verification, `email_verified` wasn't being set to `true` in the database

**Solution**:
- **Backend**: Modified `verify_otp_endpoint` in `auth_otp.py` to set `email_verified=True` (boolean) when OTP is successfully verified
- **Frontend**: Updated `EmailVerificationBanner.tsx` to handle both boolean and string values:
  ```typescript
  const isEmailVerifiedBool = emailVerifiedValue === true || emailVerifiedValue === 'true' || emailVerifiedValue === 1;
  const isEmailVerifiedString = String(emailVerifiedValue).toLowerCase() === 'true';
  ```

**Files Changed**:
- `python_api/app/routes/auth_otp.py`
- `src/components/EmailVerificationBanner.tsx`

### 2. OTP Verification Not Setting email_verified ‚úÖ

**Problem**: When OTP was verified, `email_verified` remained `false` in the database.

**Solution**: After successful OTP verification, the endpoint now:
1. Finds the user by email
2. Updates `email_verified` to `True` (boolean)
3. Sets `email_verified_at` timestamp
4. Updates `updated_at` timestamp

**Code Added**:
```python
if action == "email_verification":
    users = await db.select("users", filters={"email": email})
    if users:
        update_data = {
            "email_verified": True,  # Boolean True, not string
            "email_verified_at": dt.datetime.now(dt.timezone.utc).isoformat(),
            "updated_at": dt.datetime.now(dt.timezone.utc).isoformat()
        }
        await db.update("users", update_data, {"id": user["id"]})
```

**Files Changed**:
- `python_api/app/routes/auth_otp.py`

---

### 3. Booking Creation 500 Error ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Booking creation was failing with 500 error due to undefined `user_data` variable.

**Root Cause**: Line 462 in `records.py` referenced `user_data` which wasn't defined:
```python
await AdminNotificationService.notify_booking_submission(booking_record, property_details, user_data)
```

**Solution**: Added code to fetch user data before calling the notification service:
```python
# Fetch user data for notification
user_data_for_notification = None
if user_id:
    try:
        user_records = await db.select("users", filters={"id": user_id})
        if user_records:
            user_data_for_notification = user_records[0]
    except Exception as user_fetch_error:
        print(f"[RECORDS] Error fetching user data for notification: {user_fetch_error}")

await AdminNotificationService.notify_booking_submission(booking_record, property_details, user_data_for_notification)
```

**Files Changed**:
- `python_api/app/routes/records.py`

---

### 4. My Bookings Showing Owner Instead of Agent ‚úÖ

**Problem**: "My Bookings" page was showing property owner details as fallback when no agent was assigned.

**Solution**:
- Removed fallback to owner information
- Changed "Property Owner" label to "Agent Contact"
- Now only shows agent details if available, otherwise shows default contact info

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before: Had fallback to owner
if (property.owner_id) {
  // fetch owner data...
}

// After: No fallback to owner
// NO FALLBACK to owner - only show agent details
// If no agent assigned, show default contact info
```

**UI Changes**:
- Changed heading from "Property Owner" to "Agent Contact"

**Files Changed**:
- `src/pages/client/MyBookings.tsx`

## üìã Summary of Changes

### Backend:
1. ‚úÖ OTP verification now sets `email_verified=True` in database
2. ‚úÖ Booking creation now fetches user data before sending admin notification

### Frontend:
1. ‚úÖ Email verification banner handles boolean/string `email_verified` values
2. ‚úÖ My Bookings shows only agent contact (no owner fallback)
3. ‚úÖ Changed "Property Owner" label to "Agent Contact"

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

1. **Email Verification**:
   - Sign up with a new user
   - Verify OTP
   - Check database: `email_verified` should be `true` (boolean)
   - Email verification banner should disappear after refresh/login

2. **Booking Creation**:
   - Create a booking from property page
   - Should succeed without 500 error
   - Check admin notifications (should work without errors)

3. **My Bookings**:
   - View bookings in "My Bookings" page
   - Should show "Agent Contact" section (not "Property Owner")
   - If agent is assigned, shows agent details
   - If no agent, shows default contact info (not owner)

---

## üöÄ Deployment Status

- ‚úÖ Backend changes pushed to Git
- ‚úÖ Frontend build completed successfully
- ‚úÖ All fixes implemented
- ‚è≥ Render auto-deployment in progress

**Status**: All issues fixed! Email verification banner will now correctly hide after OTP verification, booking creation works without errors, and My Bookings shows only agent contact information.

---

## üìù Notes

- **Database Field Type**: The `email_verified` field in Supabase should ideally be a boolean, but our code now handles both boolean and string values for backward compatibility.
- **Document Display**: Documents are uploaded in the background after OTP verification (non-blocking). They should appear in the admin panel once uploaded. If documents don't appear, check:
  1. Document upload completed successfully (check browser console)
  2. Documents are associated with correct `user_id` and `entity_type='user'`
  3. Admin panel is querying with correct filters
