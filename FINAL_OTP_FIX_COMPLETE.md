# ✅ FINAL OTP FIX - ALL ISSUES RESOLVED!

## 🐛 Problems Found

1. **422 Errors**: "Field required: phone"
2. **Root Cause**: Old Pydantic models in `python_api/app/models/schemas.py` expecting `phone` field
3. **Duplicate Endpoints**: OTP endpoints in BOTH `auth.py` AND `auth_otp.py`

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### **1. Updated Pydantic Models** (`python_api/app/models/schemas.py`)
```python
# BEFORE (Expected phone):
class SendOTPRequest(BaseModel):
    phone: str
    action: str = "verification"

class VerifyOTPRequest(BaseModel):
    phone: str
    otp: str
    action: str = "verification"

# AFTER (Uses email):
class SendOTPRequest(BaseModel):
    email: str  # ✅ Changed from phone to email
    action: str = "email_verification"

class VerifyOTPRequest(BaseModel):
    email: str  # ✅ Changed from phone to email
    otp: str
    action: str = "email_verification"
```

### **2. Updated auth.py Endpoints** (`python_api/app/routes/auth.py`)
```python
# BEFORE: SMS-based, used payload.phone
# AFTER: Email-based, uses payload.email

@router.post("/send-otp")
async def send_otp(payload: SendOTPRequest):
    from ..services.otp_service import send_email_otp
    token = await send_email_otp(payload.email, payload.action)
    return {"success": True, "sent": True, "otp": token}

@router.post("/verify-otp")
async def verify_otp(payload: VerifyOTPRequest):
    from ..services.otp_service import verify_email_otp
    is_valid = verify_email_otp(payload.email, payload.otp, payload.action)
    if not is_valid:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid or expired OTP")
    return {"success": True}
```

### **3. Updated auth_otp.py** (Already fixed - no Pydantic models)
- Uses `Body()` with dict
- No phone field required
