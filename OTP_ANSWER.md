## 🎯 Will You Get OTP?

### Answer: **YES!** ✅

### How It Works:

1. **When you sign up** (as Buyer, Seller, or Agent):
   - You complete the signup form
   - Click "Create Account"

2. **OTP Screen Appears** ✨
   - Modal opens automatically
   - Shows your phone number
   - Displays 6 input boxes

3. **OTP is Sent** 📱
   - Backend calls `send-otp` API
   - OTP code is generated (6 digits)
   - Code is sent to your phone via SMS (if Twilio configured)
   - OR shown in browser console (development mode)

4. **You Enter OTP** ⌨️
   - Type each digit in the 6 boxes
   - Or paste the entire 6-digit code
   - Auto-advances between boxes

5. **Verification** ✅
   - Click "Verify OTP" button
   - Backend verifies the code
   - On success → Success screen shows
   - On failure → Error message shown

## 🔧 Backend Configuration

### OTP Service Already Exists:
- ✅ File: `python_api/app/services/otp_service.py`
- ✅ Generates 6-digit random codes
- ✅ Stores OTPs in memory
- ✅ Verifies OTP with expiration check

### OTP Routes Already Exist:
- ✅ File: `python_api/app/routes/auth_otp.py`
- ✅ Endpoint: `POST /api/auth/send-otp`
- ✅ Endpoint: `POST /api/auth/verify-otp`

### ⚠️ One Small Fix Needed:

**Backend Response Mismatch:**

Current backend returns:
```python
{"ok": True, "sent": True, "token": "123456"}
```

Frontend expects:
```python
{"success": True, "sent": True, "otp": "123456"}
```

**Fix**: Update `python_api/app/routes/auth_otp.py` lines 33 and 41:
- Change `"ok"` → `"success"`
- Change `"token"` → `"otp"`
