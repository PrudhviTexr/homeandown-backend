- **Admin**: `/admin/forgot-password`
- **Agent**: `/agent/forgot-password`
- **Seller**: `/seller/forgot-password`
- **Buyer**: `/buyer/forgot-password`
- **General**: `/forgot-password` (backward compatibility)

### ✅ 2. Role-Based Reset Password Pages
Created dedicated reset password pages for each user type:
- **Admin**: `/admin/reset-password`
- **Agent**: `/agent/reset-password`
- **Seller**: `/seller/reset-password` (uses general page)
- **Buyer**: `/buyer/reset-password` (uses general page)
- **General**: `/reset-password` (backward compatibility, auto-redirects based on user type)

### ✅ 4. Backend Implementation
