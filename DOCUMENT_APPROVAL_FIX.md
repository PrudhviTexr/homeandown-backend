# Document Approval Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **500 Error on Document Approval**: The documents table was missing the `status`, `updated_at`, and `rejection_reason` columns that the backend code was trying to update.

2. **Incorrect Documents Displayed**: Documents were not being properly filtered by entity_id, causing wrong documents to appear for each user.

3. **Data Loading Issues**: Improved document fetching with better error handling and client-side filtering.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration (`supabase/migrations/20241120_add_documents_status_column.sql`)
- Added `status` column with default value 'pending' and CHECK constraint
- Added `updated_at` timestamp column
- Added `rejection_reason` text column
- Created indexes for better query performance

### 2. Backend Updates (`python_api/app/routes/admin.py`)
- Added `Query` and `Optional` imports
- Updated `list_documents` endpoint to accept `entity_type` and `entity_id` query parameters
- Improved filtering logic to properly filter documents by entity

### 3. Frontend Updates (`src/components/admin/ViewUserModal.tsx`)
- Changed document status check from `doc.verified` to `doc.status`
- Added visual status indicators for approved/rejected documents
- Added client-side filtering to ensure only documents belonging to the specific user are displayed
- Added console logging for debugging
- Added proper error handling with toast notifications

## Migration Instructions

To apply the database migration, run:
```bash
cd python_api
# If using Supabase CLI:
supabase db push

# Or apply the migration manually to your Supabase database
```

## Testing

After applying the changes:
1. The document approval should no longer throw 500 errors
2. Only documents belonging to the specific user should be displayed
3. Document status should be properly tracked (pending, approved, rejected)
4. Approve/Reject buttons should only show for pending documents
