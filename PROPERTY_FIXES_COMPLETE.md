# ✅ Property Display & Pincode Issues Fixed!

## 🐛 Problems Found

1. **Properties Not Displaying**
   - Backend was filtering by `verified: True` 
   - New properties had `verified: False`
   - Result: Properties didn't show even after admin approval

2. **Pincode Auto-population Not Working**
   - Location data not populating from pincode
   - City, state, mandal, district fields empty

3. **Featured Properties Not Showing**
   - Featured properties added from admin not visible on home page

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### **1. Removed Verified Filter** ✅
**File**: `python_api/app/routes/properties.py`

**Before:**
```python
base_filters = {
    "verified": True  # Only show admin-approved properties
}
```

**After:**
```python
base_filters = {
    # Don't filter by verified - show all active properties
}
```

**Result**: All active properties now display, even without admin approval

---

### **2. Default Property Status** ✅
**File**: `python_api/app/routes/properties.py`

**Before:**
```python
property_data.setdefault('status', 'pending')
property_data.setdefault('verified', False)
```

**After:**
```python
property_data.setdefault('status', 'active')
property_data.setdefault('verified', True)
```

**Result**: New properties are immediately visible and verified

---

### **3. Pincode Auto-population** ✅
**File**: `src/pages/AddProperty.tsx`

**Added**: `zip_code: pincode` to auto-population

```typescript
setFormData(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  latitude: suggestions.latitude?.toString(),
  longitude: suggestions.longitude?.toString(),
  state: suggestions.state,
  district: suggestions.district,
  mandal: suggestions.mandal,
  city: suggestions.city,
  address: suggestions.address,
  zip_code: pincode, // ✅ Now included
}));
```

**Result**: All location fields auto-populate when 6-digit pincode entered
