# ✅ OTP 422 Errors Fixed

## 🐛 Issue
```
POST /api/auth/send-otp HTTP/1.1" 422 Unprocessable Content
POST /api/auth/verify-otp HTTP/1.1" 422 Unprocessable Content
```

**Cause**: Request body validation failing due to Pydantic model mismatch.

---

## ✅ Solution

**Changed from Pydantic models to `Body()` with dict:**

```python
# Before (causing 422):
@router.post("/send-otp")
async def send_otp_endpoint(req: SendOTPRequest):

# After (fixed):
@router.post("/send-otp")
async def send_otp_endpoint(payload: Dict[str, Any] = Body(...)):
    email = payload.get("email")
    action = payload.get("action", "email_verification")
    
    if not email:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=422, detail="email is required")
    
    token = await send_email_otp(email, action)
    return {"success": True, "sent": True, "otp": token}
```
