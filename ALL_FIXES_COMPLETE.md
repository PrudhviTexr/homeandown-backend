# ✅ All Fixes Complete!

## 📋 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Property Status Issue
**Problem**: Properties were being created with incorrect status or going to "sold"  
**Solution**: 
- Backend now sets property status to `'pending'` by default
- Frontend AddProperty.tsx now explicitly sets status to `'pending'`
- Properties require admin approval before going live
- Changed from `'active'` to `'pending'` for proper approval workflow

**Files Changed**:
- `python_api/app/routes/properties.py` - Line 264
- `src/pages/AddProperty.tsx` - Line 271

---

### 2. ✅ Agent Login After Approval
**Problem**: Agents couldn't login even after admin approval  
**Solution**:
- Added verification_status check for agents in login endpoint
- Login now checks both `status` and `verification_status`
- Agents must have status='active' AND verification_status='verified' or 'active'
- Added detailed logging for debugging

**Files Changed**:
- `python_api/app/routes/auth.py` - Lines 240-263

**Logic**:
```python
# Check status first
if user_status != "active":
    # Block login

# Then check verification_status for agents
if user_type == 'agent' and verification_status not in ['verified', 'active']:
    # Block agent login
```

### 3. ✅ Document Viewer Removed from Sidebar
**Problem**: "Document Viewer" menu item was showing in admin sidebar but not needed  
**Solution**:
- Removed `document-viewer` from sidebar menu items
- Removed Document Viewer case from AdminDashboard renderContent
- Removed unused imports (DocumentViewer component)

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx` - Lines 112-117 removed
- `src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Lines 32-33, 751-760

---

### 4. ✅ Documents Menu Removed from Sidebar
**Problem**: "Documents" menu item was showing in admin sidebar but not needed  
**Solution**:
- Removed `documents` from sidebar menu items
- Removed Documents case from AdminDashboard renderContent
- Removed unused imports (DocumentManagement component)

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx` - Lines 158-162 removed
- `src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Line 752 removed

---

### 5. ✅ Documents Only in User & Property Pages
**Problem**: Documents should only be visible in user/property pages, not as separate menu items  
**Solution**:
- Documents are now accessed through:
  - **View User Modal** (when viewing user details)
  - **View Property Modal** (when viewing property details)
- No standalone document pages in admin
- Cleaner sidebar navigation

**Current Access Points**:
1. Admin → Users → View User → Documents tab
2. Admin → Properties → View Property → Documents tab

- Extract to web root
- Configure `.htaccess` (already included)

### 2. Verify Backend Deployment
- Backend should auto-deploy on Render.com
- Check logs at: https://homeandown-backend.onrender.com
- Test agent approval and login flow

### 3. Test the Fixes

2. **Agent Approval**: Approve an agent, verify both status AND verification_status are set
3. **Agent Login**: Agent should be able to login after approval
4. **Documents**: Check documents only appear in user/property pages, not in sidebar
5. **Admin Sidebar**: Verify Document Viewer and Documents menus are gone

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Agent Still Can't Login
1. Check database: `SELECT status, verification_status FROM users WHERE id = 'agent_id'`
2. Both should be: status='active', verification_status='verified'
3. If not, re-approve the agent through admin panel

### Property Status Still Wrong
1. Check database: `SELECT status FROM properties WHERE id = 'property_id'`
2. Should be 'pending', 'active', 'inactive', 'sold', or 'rented'
3. If it's 'sold' when it shouldn't be, check who/what set it

### Documents Not Showing
1. Documents are ONLY in user/property detail pages
2. Look in: Admin → View User → Documents section
3. Look in: Admin → View Property → Documents section
4. NOT in sidebar menu anymore
